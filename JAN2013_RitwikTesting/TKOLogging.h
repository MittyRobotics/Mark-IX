/*! Logging CRIO Competition Page
 *
 * Introduction
 *
 * Logging during matches will be helpful for fine tuning the robot and for seeing what the CRIO thinks it is doing.
 * Versus what you told it to do...
 *
 * Installation
 *
 * Step 1: Make folder "log" in the root folder of the CRIO
 * Step 2: Create comp.txt and move it to the log folder you just created on the CRIO
 * Step 3: Test it.
 * Step 4: There is no step 4. Move along.

 * Logging class used for Competition match logging to the CRIO.
