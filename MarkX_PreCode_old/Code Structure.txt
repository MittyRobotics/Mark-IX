MarkX Pre-Season Experimental Code 
==================================

This code is experimental for the next season,
when we will make the robot Mark-X. 


This code will have a new structure.
				 
		      |--- Definitions.h ( Defines constants) 
		      |
MarkX Robot Code -----|
		      |			|-- Operator Code (Drive and Evom)
		      |--- MarkX.cpp -- |-- Autonomous Code (Self-control)
					|-- Misc Code (Camera, Logging, etc.)	

The addition of threading means that the classes can be cleaned up a little bit,
and also separated more, but the majority of change will be in the MarkX.cpp file.
