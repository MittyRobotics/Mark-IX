What did C++ say to C? "You've got no class."
C++ might be bad, but pointers are still better than a Type class, like Java: Type collectionType = new TypeToken<Collection<Integer>>(){}.getType();

What kind of coffee do programmers drink? The ones made with Java :D
- khieu the facepalm
What did people say when the new version of C came out? It's a plus

If a method is made that doesn't return anything, and it has something set to be nothing... wouldn't you say it's NULL and VOID
