Just something I thought was funny: If you think C++ is not overly complicated, just what is a protected abstract virtual base pure virtual private destructor and when was the last time you needed one? -- Tom Cargill (retrived from http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/)

Here's something else: what does 2["hello"] evaluate to?
Answer: 'l'
// saw this, thought it worked quite well -Light http://bash.org/?240849
What did C++ say to C? "You've got no class."
C++ might be bad, but pointers are still better than a Type class, like Java: Type collectionType = new TypeToken<Collection<Integer>>(){}.getType();

	Pneumatics code
	Create a simple project for camera/othertask in one task and driving/joystick movement in other task.

TODOs:
	STANDARDIZE DOCUMENTATION. -Varun
	I AM DONE WITH SIMULATOR. -Varun (Project can also be found here: https://bitbucket.org/programming1351/wpilib-simulator)
	For Gryo programming check out the gyro programming pdf in docs
	Learn about Multitasking: http://www-kryo.desy.de/documents/vxWorks/V5.5/vxworks/guide/index.html
	Learn your for- loops please. -Tanay
