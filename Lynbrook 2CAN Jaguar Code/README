The code provided in this archive is a modified excerpt of the source for The
Tail of the Monkey, intended to give a general idea and structure for
implementing a threaded CANJaguar implementation. As such, it is not guaranteed
to compile, nor work in a production environment.

That said, the code ought to work, though some of it seems somewhat awkward, as
excerpts from utility classes that we use in our codebase have been embedded
within the files that they are used. These inclusions are generally well
commented, and you may pull your own equivalents from your own libraries.

These classes are documented with Doxygen-style comments, if you generate the
full documentation, the classes are much easier to understand. Note that
AsyncCANJaguar is intended to be a drop-in replacement for the WPILib-provided
CANJaguar class, and therefore overrides every method exposed by that class.
